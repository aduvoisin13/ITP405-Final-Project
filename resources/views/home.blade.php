                To get started, click on 'Leaderboards' in the Navigation Bar and save
                your favorite characters to your account. These characters can be viewed
                from the 'Saved Characters' link in the Navigation Bar. After saving at
                least 2 characters, click on 'Compare -> New Comparison' in order to
                compare their gear. If you want to revisit the comparison later, click on
                'Save Comparison' at the bottom of the comparison; your comparison will
                be saved in 'Compare -> Saved Comparisons'. Have fun!
